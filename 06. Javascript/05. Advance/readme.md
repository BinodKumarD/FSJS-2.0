## 1. Scope

JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

## 2. strings

In JavaScript, strings are created by surrounding them with quotes. There are three ways you can use quotes.
i. Single quotes: 'Hello'
ii. Double quotes: "Hello"
iii. Backticks: `Hello`

## 3. maps

The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.
