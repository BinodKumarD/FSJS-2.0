## 1. Scope

JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

## 2. strings

In JavaScript, strings are created by surrounding them with quotes. There are three ways you can use quotes.
- Single quotes: 'Hello'
- Double quotes: "Hello"
- Backticks: \`Hello`

## 3. maps

The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

## 4. Destructure the Data

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

## 5. Spread and rest

Spread syntax can be used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in a new array or object, or should be applied one-by-one in a function call's arguments list.

## 6. Class and Objects

Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming that revolve around real-life entities. 

Classes: Classes were first introduced in the new version of the ES6 classes which replaced the previously used functions. Class is nothing but a blueprint for an object of it. It is used to create an object mainly. If we relate it to a real-life example then it is like a plan for a building or house where that plan contains details about doors, windows, floors, etc.
