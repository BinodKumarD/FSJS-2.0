## 1. Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). It is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses.

## 2. Context

In JavaScript, “context” refers to an object. Within an object, the keyword “this” refers to that object (i.e. “self”), and provides an interface to the properties and methods that are members of that object. When a function is executed, the keyword “this” refers to the object that the function is executed in.
When a function executes in the global context, “this” refers to the global, or “window” object.
