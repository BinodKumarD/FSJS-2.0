## 1. Objects

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object. Booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, functions and many others can be objects (if defined with the new keyword). 
checking the usage of this, new, prototype keywords and hasOwnProperty function.

## 2. Self Executing Function

A JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. Also known as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

## 3. Lexical scope

A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not be accessible outside that function.

## 4. Closure

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
