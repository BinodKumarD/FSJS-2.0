## 1. Hello World program

Running the javascript file through node js from vs code terminal.

![](./00.%20Output/01.Hello.jpg)

We can see the console output from web browser in the console developer.

## 2. Variables

We can reserve some memory using var, let and const keyword. and using console.log() command we can view our output in terminal.

using const keyword and different way to print multiple variables using single console log command.

## 3. Operators

In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).

## 4. Conditionals

Conditional Statements Very often used when we want to perform different actions for different decisions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

(i.)  <ins>**Applying conditional in temperature.**</ins>

(ii.)  <ins>**Applying conditional in purchase.**</ins>

(iii.)  <ins>**Applying conditional in Login to a website.**</ins>

## 5. Ternary Operator  

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. We can say ternary operator is shorthand expression for if-else statement.

## 6. Switch statement

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It select one of many code blocks to be executed.
This is how it works:

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

## 7. Truthy and falsy

In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. That is, all values are truthy except false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, and NaN.
