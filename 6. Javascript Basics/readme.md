## 4. Conditionals

Conditional Statements Very often used when we want to perform different actions for different decisions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Applying conditional in temperature.
